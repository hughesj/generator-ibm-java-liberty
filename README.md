This is a yeoman generator that produces MicroProfile / Java EE projects.

## Overview
The generator works by taking the answers that the user has supplied, either via the CLI or a UI, and then maps that
to a folder under the templates directory. All files are processed using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) to insert the configuration specified by the user.

## Running the generator

This is a sub generator and is intended to work with the main [Java code generator](https://github.com/ibm-developer/generator-ibm-java). This generator is listed as a dependency in the [package.json](https://github.com/ibm-developer/generator-ibm-java/blob/master/generator-java/package.json) which means that it will be installed automatically. Follow the build instructions on the [Java generator](https://github.com/ibm-developer/generator-ibm-java) then additionally

* Fork or clone this repository locally.
* Change into the `generator-liberty` directory (where the *package.json* file is)
* Run `npm link` - this will configure your local node installation to resolve this generator from the local file system rather than the NPM registry.

You will now be able to make changes locally and have them picked up when you run the main Java generator.

## Contribution

In order to publish changes, you will need to fork the repository or ask to join the `ibm-developer` org and branch off the `master` branch.

Make sure to follow the [conventional commit specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) before contributing. To help you with commit a commit template is provide.
Run `config.sh` to initialize the commit template to your `.git/config` or you can use

Once you are finished with your changes, run `npm test` to make sure all tests pass.

Do a pull request against `master`, make sure the build passes. A team member will review and merge your pull request.
Once merged to `master` one pull request will be created against `master`. Make sure that the CHANGELOG.md and the package.json is correct before merging the auto generated pull request. After the autogenerated
pull request has been merged to `master` the version will be bumped and published to npm.
